# Part I: Product Foundation

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

### 1.1 The Product

Finite visualizes human life as a grid of ~4,000 weeks. It transforms abstract mortality into tangible awareness, creating urgency and intentionality.

**Core Insight:** Mortality IS the ultimate deadline. When you see your life as finite weeks, every week becomes a choice.

### 1.2 The Feeling

Users should feel like they're opening the book of their own life — one that rewards attention, reveals layers over time, and treats their existence with the gravity it deserves.

We draw emotional architecture from complex narratives (Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan, One Piece) and craft standards from the world's slickest apps (Things 3, Linear, Superhuman, Arc Browser).

### 1.3 Narrative UX Framework

Great stories create specific feelings through structural patterns. These patterns are encoded into our interaction design:

| Narrative Element | Emotional Effect | UX Translation |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Layered Revelation** | "There's more than I first saw" | Progressive disclosure; features unlock over use; patterns emerge from data |
| **Interconnection** | "Everything is connected" | Visual threads between milestones; tap a week, see what it touches |
| **Weight & Consequence** | "The past shapes the future" | Lived weeks feel different than empty ones; accumulation has texture |
| **Scale Beyond View** | "I'm part of something vast" | Grid implies infinity; subtle depth effects; breathing at edges |
| **Perspective Shifts** | "Same story, new meaning" | View modes as plot twists; same data, transformed understanding |

### 1.4 Craft Standards

**From Things 3:**
- Every detail matters — custom UI components, consistent corners
- "It blends in so well I didn't even think about it — the epitome of good design"

**From Linear:**
- Speed as feature; actions feel instant
- Settings as onboarding — use customization to educate

**From Superhuman:**
- Obsessive attention to detail commands respect
- "Like getting a flashlight that's a little brighter, a pen that's a bit slicker"

**From Arc Browser:**
- Multi-sensory onboarding; make users *feel* something from first launch
- Optimize for feelings over data

## 2. Target Market: The 29+ Demographic

### 2.1 Why 29+?

Adults 29+ are fundamentally different from younger users. They represent Finite's ideal market because mortality awareness is no longer abstract — they've experienced loss and feel time's weight.

### 2.2 What 29+ Users Have

- **Higher stakes:** Careers, mortgages, relationships, aging parents
- **Less time tolerance:** No patience for gamification that feels juvenile
- **Genuine mortality awareness:** Unlike 22-year-olds, they've confronted finitude
- **Disposable income:** Willing to pay for tools that genuinely work
- **Decision fatigue:** Value simplicity and clarity over feature bloat

### 2.3 What 29+ Users DON'T Want

- Streaks that feel like manipulation (Duolingo owl energy)
- Badges and achievements that feel patronizing
- Confetti, celebrations, and performative positivity
- Social features that feel like social media
- Complexity masquerading as depth

### 2.4 What 29+ Users WANT

- Tools that respect their intelligence
- Privacy and personal reflection space
- Meaningful visualization of abstract concepts (time, life, progress)
- Rituals that feel earned, not prescribed
- Confrontation over comfort

### 2.5 What 29+ Users SHARE

This demographic shares differently than Gen Z:

| They Share | They Don't Share |
|------------|-----------------|
| Accomplishments with gravitas | Daily check-ins |
| Wisdom/perspective | Streaks or points |
| Life transitions | Gamification badges |
| Reflections that make them look thoughtful | "Look at me" content |
| Moments of meaning | Random status updates |

**Key insight:** 29+ adults share **identity-affirming content** that positions them as thoughtful, intentional people.

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Core Principles

1. **Earned Complexity** — Start simple. Let depth reveal itself over time.
2. **Weight Without Heaviness** — Life is serious; the app shouldn't be oppressive.
3. **Every Pixel Means Something** — No decoration. Every element serves purpose.
4. **Signature Moments** — 2-3 interactions that are *unmistakably* Finite.
5. **Temporal Gravity** — Past, present, and future should feel different.

### 3.2 Friction Philosophy

- Lowest possible friction for primary actions
- Deliberate friction for irreversible actions (delete confirmation)
- Zero friction for exploration (swipe between views freely)

### 3.3 Information Hierarchy

1. **The Grid** — Always primary, always visible
2. **Current Week** — The anchor point, always prominent
3. **View-Specific Context** — Footer/context bar changes per mode
4. **Navigation** — Minimal, discoverable through gesture

---

## 4. Behavioral Psychology Framework

Most apps use surface-level psychology (streaks, badges, notifications). Finite goes deeper because mortality awareness IS the core product. The psychology doesn't need to be grafted on — it's intrinsic.

### 4.1 Mortality Salience (Terror Management Theory)

**Research Source:** Greenberg, Pyszczynski & Solomon (Terror Management Theory); PLOS One 2021

**The Science:** Terror Management Theory shows that awareness of death triggers psychological defense mechanisms that profoundly change behavior. Mortality salience activates both proximal defenses (immediate coping) and distal defenses (pursuing meaningful goals, self-esteem enhancement).

**What Competitors Miss:** Apps like WeCroak send death reminders but don't channel the response. They trigger anxiety without providing a constructive outlet. Research shows mortality salience increases prosocial behavior, goal pursuit, and self-regulation when channeled properly.

**Finite's Advantage:** The grid IS the constructive outlet. When users feel mortality salience from seeing their life visualized, they need a place to put that energy. The weekly rating ritual transforms anxiety into reflection. The milestone feature transforms it into intentional planning.

**Implementation:** Instead of push notifications that say "You have X weeks left" (WeCroak style), show the grid with a subtle animation of the current week fading. Visual representations of time create stronger mortality salience than text. Immediate ability to rate the week or set a milestone channels the emotion constructively.

### 4.2 Fresh Start Effect (Temporal Landmarks)

**Research Source:** Dai, Milkman & Riis (2014), Management Science

**The Science:** Temporal landmarks (birthdays, new years, Mondays, month beginnings) motivate aspirational behavior by creating psychological "fresh starts" that help people distance themselves from past failures. Birthdays are the strongest trigger.

**What Competitors Miss:** Most apps treat all days equally. They might offer "New Year" features but miss the hundreds of micro-landmarks throughout the year.

**Finite's Advantage:** Every week IS a temporal landmark. Every row (year) is a fresh start. Every life phase transition is a major landmark. This is built into Finite's DNA.

**Implementation:** Sunday evening prompt: "Week 1,547 is complete. Rate it and begin Week 1,548." Year-row transitions get special treatment — visual celebration when moving to a new row. Birthday weeks highlighted as major landmarks with special grid visualization.

### 4.3 Loss Aversion & The Endowment Effect

**Research Source:** Kahneman & Tversky (Prospect Theory, 1979)

**The Science:** Losses are psychologically twice as powerful as equivalent gains. The Endowment Effect extends this: once we "own" something, we value it more and fear losing it.

**What Competitors Miss:** Apps use loss aversion crudely through streak breaking. "Your 50-day streak!" feels manipulative because the streak has no intrinsic value — it's artificial scarcity.

**Finite's Advantage:** The weeks themselves are the scarcity. You can't get them back. This is REAL loss, not manufactured. The filled circles on your grid represent actual time invested — the ultimate endowment.

**Implementation:** "The Irreversible Mark" — Once a week is rated, it cannot be changed (or requires significant friction to change). Each rating decision matters. Unrated past weeks show as faded/empty — representing "lost" opportunities to capture that time.

### 4.4 Commitment Devices & Pre-Commitment

**Research Source:** Rogers et al. (2014), JAMA

**The Science:** Commitment devices — self-imposed constraints that increase the cost of deviation — significantly improve goal achievement. People actively choose to bind their future selves because they recognize their own self-control problems.

**Finite's Advantage:** "Horizons" feature creates commitment without external punishment. Setting a milestone ("Run a marathon by Week 1,600") on the grid creates psychological commitment. The deadline IS mortality.

**Implementation:** Users place future milestones on the grid — they become visible markers. The closer you get to a milestone, the more prominent it becomes. If deadline passes without completion, the milestone remains visible as a question mark — not punishment, but honest record.

### 4.5 Implementation Intentions

**Research Source:** Gollwitzer (1999); Fabulous app case study

**The Science:** Planning the specific when/where/how of a behavior dramatically increases follow-through. The Fabulous app saw 40% improvement in D7/D14 retention by adding "commitment contracts" with specific timing.

**Finite's Advantage:** The weekly ritual IS an implementation intention. "Every Sunday at 8pm, I rate my week." This habit loop naturally emerges from the product structure.

**Implementation:** "The Sunday Ritual" — Users set their preferred "Week End" time during onboarding. Single gentle notification at that time: "Week 1,547 awaits your reflection." The ritual takes <60 seconds — low friction, high meaning. Over time, this becomes identity: "I'm someone who reflects on their weeks."

### 4.6 Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (Sharing Psychology)

**Research Source:** Marilynn Brewer (1991); Spotify Wrapped behavioral analysis

**The Science:** People are torn between two needs: validation/similarity to others AND uniqueness/individuation. The most shareable content satisfies BOTH — it says "I belong" (everyone's sharing this) AND "I'm unique" (my result is mine).

**What Competitors Miss:** Most share features focus only on achievement or only on participation. Spotify Wrapped succeeds because it gives everyone the same format (belonging) with personalized content (uniqueness).

**Finite's Application:** The Week Card format is universal (everyone shares the same card style) but the content is deeply personal (your specific week, your perspective, your position in time). Users share to express identity, not just to show off.

**Key Insight from Research:** "The goal of Wrapped is virality. That's absolutely the overriding goal." — Spotify's data lead. Every design choice should pass one test: "Does this increase the likelihood of sharing?"

## 7. Signature Interactions

These are the "plot twist" moments — interactions users will remember and tell others about.

### 7.1 View Mode Transitions (The Perspective Shift)

Switching views isn't a filter change — it's a *recontextualization* of your entire life.

```
Chapters → Quality:
1. Grid pauses (50ms)
2. Colors desaturate to grayscale (150ms, ease-out)
3. Beat of stillness (100ms)
4. New colors bloom from current week outward (300ms, spring)
5. Haptic: single subtle pulse at color arrival

Chapters → Focus:
1. Colors drain toward edges (200ms)
2. Screen dims slightly (10% darker)
3. Ghost number fades in from below (400ms, ease-out-back)
4. Haptic: slow, heavy pulse

Focus → Horizons:
1. Ghost number rises and fades (200ms)
2. Past weeks dim to 30% (250ms)
3. Milestone markers pulse once in sequence (50ms each)
4. Context bar slides up (300ms, spring)
5. Haptic: ascending sequence of 3 soft taps
```

### 7.2 First Launch Sequence (The Scale Revelation)

```
1. FADE IN: Black screen (500ms)

2. TITLE: "finite" in center
   - Fades in (400ms), holds (800ms), fades out (300ms)

3. ZOOM: Single dot appears center screen
   - Label: "This is one week"
   - Holds (1.5s)

4. EXPAND: Grid expands around it
   - 52 dots form a row: "This is one year"
   - Holds (1.2s)

5. FULL GRID: Entire life zooms out
   - Current week pulses
   - Lived weeks filled, future empty
   - Haptic: heavy single pulse
   - Label: "[X] weeks lived. [Y] weeks possible."
   - Holds (2s)

6. TRANSITION: Grid settles into normal view
```

### 7.3 The Ghost Number (Focus View)

The barely-visible weeks-remaining counter that can be summoned.

```
Default state:
- 8% opacity (nearly invisible)
- Large display font at bottom of screen

Summon (tap):
- Animate to 100% opacity (200ms)
- Haptic: hollow, resonant pulse
- Hold at 100% for 2 seconds
- Fade back to 8% (400ms, ease-out)

FIRST TIME ONLY:
- After fade, show Share Perspective prompt
```

### 7.4 Connection Web (Horizons View — V2)

Long-press milestone to reveal its narrative connections.

```
Trigger: Long-press milestone marker (500ms)

Response:
1. Selected milestone grows (1.1x, 150ms)
2. Radial pulse emanates
3. Lines draw to:
   - Previous milestone (what led here)
   - Next milestone (what follows)
   - Current week (distance from now)
4. Lines: 1pt, category color @ 40%, gradient fade
5. Connected milestones pulse softly
6. Haptic: soft tick per connection
```

### 7.5 Breathing Aura (All Views)

Edges of grid have slow-pulsing gradient that implies life beyond the frame.

```
- 15% opacity, shifts slowly
- Chapters: warm gradient (life extending)
- Focus: cool gradient (infinite void)
- Horizons: forward-facing gradient (future pulling)
- Animation: 4s cycle, ease-in-out
```

## 10. Grid System

### 10.1 Visual Elements

| Element | Symbol | Size | Description |
|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| Past week | ● | 6pt | Lived, filled |
| Current week | ◉ | 6pt + pulse | Now, animated |
| Future week | ○ | 6pt | Remaining, empty |
| Milestone | ⬡ | 8pt | Goal anchor, hexagon |
| Completed | ✓ | 8pt | Achieved, faded |
| Overdue | ⬡! | 8pt + badge | Past due, red tint |

### 10.2 Week Rendering Logic

```swift
func weekView(for weekNumber: Int, in viewMode: ViewMode) -> some View {
    let milestone = milestonesByWeek[weekNumber]?.first
    
    // Shape
    let shape: some Shape = {
        if milestone != nil { return Hexagon() }
        return Circle()
    }()
    
    // Size
    let size: CGFloat = milestone != nil ? 8 : 6
    
    // Color
    let color = weekColor(weekNumber, viewMode: viewMode, milestone: milestone)
    
    // Animation
    let shouldPulse = weekNumber == currentWeekNumber
    
    return shape
        .fill(color)
        .frame(width: size, height: size)
        .modifier(PulseModifier(active: shouldPulse))
}
```

### 10.3 View-Specific Colors

#### Chapters
```swift
func chaptersColor(for weekNumber: Int) -> Color {
    guard let phase = phase(for: weekNumber) else {
        return weekNumber < currentWeekNumber 
            ? Color("week-filled") 
            : Color("week-empty")
    }
    return Color(phase.colorName)
}
```

#### Quality
```swift
func qualityColor(for weekNumber: Int) -> Color {
    guard weekNumber < currentWeekNumber else {
        return Color("week-empty")
    }
    guard let rating = weekRating(for: weekNumber) else {
        return Color("week-unrated")  // Muted gray
    }
    return Color("quality-\(rating)")  // 1-5 spectrum
}
```

#### Focus
```swift
func focusColor(for weekNumber: Int) -> Color {
    weekNumber < currentWeekNumber ? .white : .black
}
```

#### Horizons
```swift
func horizonsColor(for weekNumber: Int, milestone: Milestone?) -> Color {
    if let milestone = milestone {
        switch milestone.status(currentWeek: currentWeekNumber) {
        case .upcoming, .thisWeek:
            return milestone.category?.color ?? Color("text-primary")
        case .overdue:
            return Color.red.opacity(0.8)
        case .completed:
            return Color("text-secondary").opacity(0.5)
        }
    }
    
    if weekNumber < currentWeekNumber {
        return Color("week-filled").opacity(0.3)
    } else if weekNumber == currentWeekNumber {
        return Color("week-current")
    } else {
        return Color("week-empty")
    }
}
```

### 10.4 Marker Density Handling

**Adjacent Milestones (1-2 weeks apart):**
- Both markers show, may overlap slightly
- Creates visual "cluster" effect

**Same Week Milestones:**
- Show first marker with count badge: `⬡²`
- Tap opens list filtered to that week

```swift
func markerForWeek(_ weekNumber: Int) -> some View {
    let milestones = milestonesByWeek[weekNumber] ?? []
    
    if milestones.count > 1 {
        MilestoneMarker(milestone: milestones.first!)
            .overlay(alignment: .topTrailing) {
                Text("\(milestones.count)")
                    .font(.system(size: 6, weight: .bold))
                    .foregroundStyle(.white)
                    .padding(2)
                    .background(Circle().fill(Color.red))
                    .offset(x: 4, y: -4)
            }
    } else if let milestone = milestones.first {
        MilestoneMarker(milestone: milestone)
    } else {
        EmptyWeekDot()
    }
}
```

    static let displayLarge = Font.system(size: 96, weight: .ultraLight)
    
    // Title - App title
    static let title = Font.system(size: 28, weight: .semibold)
    
    // Title2 - Sheet headers

    // Subtitle - Phase/milestone names
    static let subtitle = Font.system(size: 17, weight: .regular)
    
    // Body - Descriptions
    static let body = Font.system(size: 15, weight: .regular)
    
    // Caption - Week counts

## 14. Edge Cases

### 14.1 Milestone Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| Milestone on current week | Status = `.thisWeek`, context bar shows "This week" |
| Multiple same-week milestones | Count badge, tap opens filtered list |
| Overdue milestone | Red tint, "Overdue" section in list, still completable |
| Far future (beyond expectancy) | Allow it, no warning |
| Empty name | Save button disabled |
| Rapid add/delete | SwiftData handles; haptic per action |

### 14.2 Grid Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| User at end of expected lifespan | Extended grid, no hard cutoff |
| Scroll beyond lifespan | Subtle resistance, then allow with faded grid |
| Milestone beyond visible grid | Indicator: "X milestones beyond view" |

### 14.3 State Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| App opens after weeks away | "Welcome back. X weeks have passed." |
| Milestone became "this week" | Subtle notification on launch |
| Data corruption | Error state with reset option, iCloud backup |
| No network (if sync added) | "Your life continues offline" |

### 14.4 Empty States

**No Milestones (Horizons):**
```
"The future is unwritten.
What are you moving toward?"
[Create First Horizon]
```

**No Ratings (Quality):**
```
"Every week is a story.
How was this one?"
[Rate This Week]
```

---

## 15. Accessibility

### 15.1 VoiceOver Labels

```swift
// Milestone marker
MilestoneMarker(milestone: milestone)
    .accessibilityLabel("\(milestone.name)")
    .accessibilityValue("Target age \(milestone.targetAge), \(milestone.weeksRemaining) weeks remaining")
    .accessibilityHint("Double tap to view details")
    .accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)

// Context bar
MilestoneContextBar(...)
    .accessibilityLabel("Next horizon: \(milestone.name)")
    .accessibilityValue("\(milestone.weeksRemaining) weeks until age \(milestone.targetAge)")
    .accessibilityHint("Double tap to see all horizons")

// Future week
Circle()
    .accessibilityLabel("Week \(weekNumber), age \(weekAge)")
    .accessibilityHint("Double tap to set a horizon")
    .accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)

// Ghost number
GhostNumber(value: weeksRemaining)
    .accessibilityLabel("\(weeksRemaining) weeks remaining")
    .accessibilityHint("Double tap to reveal")
```

### 15.2 Dynamic Type

- All text scales with system settings
- Grid cell size fixed (accessibility alternative: list view)
- Minimum touch targets: 44pt

### 15.3 Reduce Motion

```swift
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

var animation: Animation {
    reduceMotion ? .none : .finiteSpring
}
```

### 15.4 Color Contrast

- All text meets WCAG AA
- Milestone markers: sufficient contrast on grid
- Category colors have accessible variants

# Part III: Virality & Share System

---

## 16. The Virality Problem (Solved)

### 16.1 What Was Wrong

The original share implementation failed because:

| Issue | Psychology Violated |
|-------|-------------------|
| Share button in Settings | No emotional context. Utilities don't spark sharing. |
| Long-press as primary entry | Hidden gesture = discovered by ~2% of users |
| "Week number only" content | Missing narrative. No identity expression. |
| No trigger moment | No psychological "share now" impulse |
| 4 styles × 2 formats | Decision paralysis. Spotify Wrapped has ONE format. |

**Core problem:** Sharing was treated as a feature to access, not a moment to experience.

### 16.2 The Research Foundation

From Spotify Wrapped behavioral analysis:

> "The goal of Wrapped is virality. That's absolutely the overriding goal. If [a feature] derailed virality even 1%, it was a no-go."

From Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (Brewer, 1991):

> People share content that satisfies TWO needs simultaneously: belonging (everyone shares this) AND uniqueness (my content is mine).

From behavioral studies on sharing:

> "Users are co-creators of the content. This connection creates attachment."

### 16.3 The Solution: Moment-Based Sharing

Instead of "Share My Week" as a feature, we create **share-worthy moments** at emotional peaks:

| Moment | Emotional State | Share Content |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| First week rated | "I've started something" | Perspective Card |
| Milestone completed | "I achieved something" | Achievement Card |
| Ghost number reveal | "This is heavy" | Perspective Card |
| Birthday week | "New chapter" | Year Transition Card |
| Year end | "Reflection time" | Life Wrapped |

**Key insight:** The share prompt appears AFTER the emotional peak, when the user is already feeling something worth expressing.

---

## 17. Share Card System

### 17.1 Card Types

| Card Type | Trigger | Content | Priority |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Perspective Card** | First rating, Ghost reveal, on-demand | Week + Position + Quote | A-Tier |
| **Achievement Card** | Milestone completed | Milestone + Journey + Week | A-Tier |
| **Year Transition Card** | Birthday week | New year of life | B-Tier |
| **Life Wrapped** | December / on-demand | Annual summary | S-Tier (Phase 6) |

### 17.2 Card Styles (Simplified)

**From 8 options to 2:**

| Style | Background | Text | Use Case |
|-------|------------|------|----------|
| **Dark** | #0A0A0A | White | Default. Stories-optimized. High contrast. |
| **Light** | #FAFAFA | #1A1A1A | For users who prefer light mode. |

**Format:** Stories (1080×1920) only for V1. This is where viral content lives.

**Why simplify:** 
- Fewer choices = faster sharing
- Spotify Wrapped uses ONE format
- Decision paralysis kills conversion

### 17.3 The Perspective Card

The primary shareable artifact. Expresses identity, not just data.

### 17.6 The Perspective Quote System

Instead of just sharing data, users share their *perspective* on life.

**Default quotes (user can pick or write their own):**
```swift
let defaultPerspectives = [
    "I'm learning to pay attention to my time.",
    "Every week is a decision.",
    "This is week one of the rest of my life.",
    "Mortality makes meaning.",
    "I'm not running out of time. I'm running in time.",
    "The future is a blank page I get to write.",
    "Time is the only thing I can't get back."
]
```

**Custom quote:** Users can write their own (60 character limit)

**Why this works:** Transforms data-sharing into identity-expression. The user is saying something about WHO THEY ARE, not just where they are.

            rootVC.present(activityVC, animated: true)
        }
        
        // Record analytics

    private func recordShareEvent(type: ShareCard.ShareCardType) {
        // Analytics implementation
    }
}
```

### 19.3 Perspective Quote Picker

```swift
struct PerspectiveQuotePicker: View {
    @Binding var selectedQuote: String
    @State private var isCustom = false
    @State private var customText = ""
    
    let defaultQuotes = [
        "I'm learning to pay attention to my time.",
        "Every week is a decision.",
        "This is week one of the rest of my life.",
        "Mortality makes meaning.",
        "I'm not running out of time. I'm running in time.",
        "The future is a blank page I get to write."
    ]
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
            Text("YOUR PERSPECTIVE")
                .font(.caption)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
            
            Menu {
                ForEach(defaultQuotes, id: \.self) { quote in
                    Button(quote) {
                        selectedQuote = quote
                        isCustom = false
                    }
                }
                
                Divider()
                
                Button("Write your own...") {
                    isCustom = true
                }
            } label: {
                HStack {
                    Text(isCustom ? customText : selectedQuote)
                        .lineLimit(2)
                    Spacer()
                    Image(systemName: "chevron.down")

                .padding()
                .background(Color(.secondarySystemBackground))
                .cornerRadius(8)
            }
            
            if isCustom {
                TextField("Your perspective (60 chars)", text: $customText)
                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                    .onChange(of: customText) { _, newValue in
                        if newValue.count <= 60 {
                            selectedQuote = newValue
                        } else {
                            customText = String(newValue.prefix(60))
                        }
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 20. The Viral Question

Every share must include the hook that creates curiosity:

> **"What's your week number?"**

This is Finite's equivalent of "What's your Wrapped?" — a social question that:

1. **Creates curiosity** — Viewer doesn't know what "week number" means
2. **Requires the app to answer** — You need Finite to calculate it
3. **Becomes cultural** — "What's your week?" can become a social phrase

**Implementation:** Every card includes this question near the bottom, plus the app name.

---

## 21. Web Preview for Conversion

### 21.1 Concept

A simple web page (finite.app/preview) where anyone can enter their birth date and instantly see their week number. This removes the download barrier and creates the "aha" moment before commitment.

### 21.2 URL Structure

- `finite.app/preview` — Main calculator
- `finite.app/week/1547` — Direct link to a week (from share cards)

### 21.3 Technical Requirements

- **No login required** — Instant calculation
- **No data stored** — Privacy by design
- **Fast** — Result appears within 500ms
- **Mobile-first** — Primary traffic will be mobile
- **Deep link ready** — finite.app/week/1547 pre-fills result

### 21.4 Conversion Path

```
See share card → "What's your week number?"
    ↓
Visit finite.app/preview
    ↓
Enter birth date
    ↓
See own week number (emotional impact)
    ↓
"See Your Full Grid" → App Store
    ↓
Download → First launch sequence → Own share moment
```

### 21.5 Metadata for Link Previews

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Week 1,547">
<meta property="og:description" content="I've lived 37% of my expected life. What's your week number?">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://finite.app/cards/preview.png">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://finite.app/week/1547">
```

## 22. Home Screen Widget

**The passive viral surface**

### 22.1 Concept

A home screen widget showing the user's current week. When friends see the widget on the user's phone, it creates organic curiosity: "What's that app? What's week 1,547?"

### 22.2 Widget Sizes

#### Small (2x2)

```
┌───────────────────┐

### 22.3 Configuration Options

- **Show:** Week number / Weeks remaining / Percentage lived
- **Theme:** Dark / Light / Auto

## 23. Life Wrapped (Phase 6 — December)

**The annual summary — Finite's "Spotify Wrapped"**

### 23.1 Concept

At the end of each year (or on demand), generate a beautiful, shareable summary of the user's year in weeks. This is the highest-impact viral feature, designed to be shared widely during the natural "year in review" moment.

### 23.2 Timing

- **Auto-trigger:** Last week of December
- **Manual access:** "Generate My Year" in settings (any time)
- **Historical:** "View 2024 Wrapped" for past years

### 23.3 The Sequence (7 screens)

1. **Opening:** "YOUR 2025" — 52 weeks. One life.
2. **The Grid:** Shows this year's row highlighted on full life grid
3. **Quality Summary:** Weeks rated, average rating, overall assessment
4. **Best Week:** Highlight of the year with user's notes
5. **Milestones:** Horizons set, horizons reached
6. **The Number:** "X weeks remain in your life. Make them count."
7. **Share Card:** Final summary → "Share My Year"

### 23.4 Final Share Card

## 24. What to Remove (Anti-Patterns)

### 24.1 Removed from V1

| Feature | Why Removed |
|---------|-------------|
| Share button in Settings | Anti-pattern. No emotional context. |
| 4 style options | Decision paralysis. Keep 2 (Dark/Light). |
| Square format | Stories is where virality lives. V2 if requested. |
| Grid variant card | Too complex. Simplify to essential. |
| Minimal variant | Redundant. Dark/Light is enough. |

### 24.2 Preserved (Secondary)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Long-press current week | Keep as secondary entry point for power users |

---

---

## 27. What to Explicitly AVOID

Features and patterns that would alienate the 29+ market:

- **Daily check-in requirements** — Weekly is enough. Respect their time.
- **Aggressive notifications** — One gentle reminder per week max. No push notification spam.
- **Badges and achievements** — Feels patronizing. The grid itself is the achievement.
- **Confetti and excessive celebrations** — This is a serious app about mortality. Sobriety, not celebration.
- **Social comparison/leaderboards** — Life isn't a competition. Personal reflection only.
- **AI suggestions** — Human reflection, not algorithmic optimization.
- **Complex journaling** — Keep it to spectrum + category + optional note. No friction.
- **Required social features** — Everything social should be opt-in, not default.
- **Streaks by default** — Only for users who explicitly enable them.
- **Share buttons in Settings** — Anti-pattern. No emotional context.
- **Too many card options** — Decision paralysis kills conversion.
